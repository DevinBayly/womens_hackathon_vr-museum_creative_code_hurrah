# Introduction to Creative coding
* "(Creative Coding) is a process, based on exploration, iteration, reflection and discovery, where code is used as the primary medium to create a wide range of media artifacts." -- Mark Mitchell, Oliver Brown
* https://timrodenbroeker.de/what-is-creative-coding/

# OpenProcessing

* https://openprocessing.org/discover/#/trending
* Spend some time exploring what's on here

---
# Making Accounts

* go to https://openprocessing.org/join
* sign up with a username, email, and password

---
# Explore adding a sketch to a curation

* Find something that you liked from the discover page https://openprocessing.org/discover/#/trending
* fork and save it
* then go to the curation page here https://openprocessing.org/curation/87647 and we are going to submit this sketch
* learning to update a thumbnail, and giving a description and title
* if done correctly we will get a sketch submitted to the museum https://devinbayly.github.io/womens_hackathon_vr-museum_creative_code_hurrah/?curation=87647

# Learning about what you can modify

* we are all going to start from scratch now, https://openprocessing.org/sketch/2232461
* the p5 processing reference is https://p5js.org/reference/
* we are going to learn to modify some of the options like color 
      * stroke and fill are best to start with
      * trying out https://coolors.co/
* shapes 
      * play with changing up which shape we use, from circle to square or even triangle
      * https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/rect
      * https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/triangle

* don't forget to submit to the curation https://openprocessing.org/curation/87647

# Learning about Flow

* in this exercise we are going to learn about what's called conditionals and loops
* https://openprocessing.org/sketch/2232471
* Don't forget to submit the creation to the curation

# Sol LeWitt and procedural art

```
Must an artist use his or her own hands to create a work of art?

Which is more important: the object or the idea? Why?
```

* https://www.nga.gov/learn/teachers/lessons-activities/new-angles/sol-lewitt.html
* https://landmarks.utexas.edu/activity-guide/adolescents-11

* example
      * draw a box
      * draw three lines that start and end at different sides of the box,
      * put a circle at the ends of lines that connect to a side with more than one line connecting it
      * start a new box on any of the sides that don't have circles along them

* exercise
      * think through your own 3 step procedural are piece

# Prompt engineering 

* It can be hard to get started with converting this to 
* Lets experiment with chatgpt and prompt engineering our way to an example of our procedure from above
* https://chat.openai.com/

---
# Wrap up

* questions?
* presentation options? Anyone feel like they would like to share their work at the end of the day?

## Otherwise the rest of the time is yours to play around
